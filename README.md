## Data access

The zoning maps of the singular soils, the location of sampling points, the database of the parameters of each singular soil and articles are available in this repository.

Other information are available upon request to the corresponding authors.

The complete author list for this investigation is stated below:

* [Bravo-Zapata, Matías F.] (mailto:mfbravozapata@gmail.com)
* Dorador, Leonardo

The first version of the zoning map was made during Matías Bravo's professional practice at EGSciences during 2021. In 2022, the idea of the public repository and article began to be developed, providing a description of the unique soils and the associated engineering problems. Finally, in August 2023 the article is submitted to the 17th PAN-AMERICAN CONFERENCE ON SOIL MECHANICS AND GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING and 2nd LATIN-AMERICAN REGIONAL CONFERENCE OF IAEG 2024
